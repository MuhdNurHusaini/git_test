    <p>Cats, also called domestic cats (Felis catus), are small, carnivorous mammals, of the family Felidae.[3][4]

        Domestic cats are often called 'house cats' when kept as indoor pets.[5] Cats have been domesticated (tamed) for nearly 10,000 years.[6]
        
        They are one of the most popular pets in the world. Humans keep them for hunting rodents and as friends.
        
        There are also farm cats, which are kept on farms to keep rodents away; and feral cats, which are domestic cats that live away from humans.[7]</p>
